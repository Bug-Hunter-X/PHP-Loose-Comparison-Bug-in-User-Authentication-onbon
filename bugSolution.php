The solution is to replace the loose comparison (`==`) with a strict comparison (`===`). Strict comparison checks for both type and value equality, preventing the unexpected conversion of non-numeric strings to 0. 

```php
$username = $_POST['username'];
if ($username === 0 || empty($username)) {
  echo "Username cannot be empty.";
}
```

This revised code explicitly checks if `$username` is equal to 0 and also uses the `empty()` function to accurately determine if the username is empty, eliminating the issue caused by PHP's loose comparison behavior.  This is a safer and more reliable approach for authentication and validation.
